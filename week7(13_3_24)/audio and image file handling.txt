=>audio and image file handling
*audio file 0 to 1 sec contain infinet amplitudes
*sampling:- 
* within one sec how many amplitudes --- sampling rate=sample/sec (ex:-8000)
*extensions:- .mp3 (moving pictures experts group:-mpeg),auc,

*header:- mapped to formats like mp3,auc ...
*data:-

*codec:- coder and decoder

#in matlab for real audio:- x,fs = audioread("filename")
#plot(x)
#size(x);- based on number of channels   x[:,1];- for right channel , x[:,2] for left channel

#audio files 2 types:- mono and sterio
#earphones pin:- 1 for mic, right ,left
* amplitude and delay :- gives 
#audo file ;- left (a1x1(t-t1) and right (a2x2(t-t2) channels



#for python

*scipy
